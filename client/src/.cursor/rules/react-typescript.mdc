- Never use TailwindCSS
- Use Chakra components over native JSX / HTML
- Always use function based React components
- Each file should `export default` the component that is named in the file
- When dealing with colors, we should only use the appropriate colors from `colors.ts`
- Only ever use the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`
- When dealing with forms, we should always use `react-hook-form` and the `zod` resolver
